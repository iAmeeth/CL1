Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe. In an older and closely related meaning, science also refers to this body of knowledge itself, of the type that can be rationally explained and reliably applied. Ever since classical antiquity, science as a type of knowledge has been closely linked to philosophy. In the West during the early modern period the term Science and Natural Philosophy were sometimes used interchangeably to refer to the study of natural phenomena and, until the 19th century, natural philosophy was considered a branch of philosophy.
